            <h1>APPLE MACBOOK PRO 16-INCH REVIEW: THE ONE YOU’VE BEEN WAITING FOR</h1>

            <p><span>T</span>he keyboard is fixed.

                If Apple did nothing else, that one thing makes the 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro better than its predecessor and any other MacBook you can buy right now. The tide definitively turned against Apple’s butterfly keyboard design in the past year, thanks in large part to persistent reporting from Casey Johnston and Joanna Stern, and Apple had to do something. Thankfully, Apple did the right thing: it went back to a more traditional keyboard design.
                
                But Apple’s backtrack on the keyboard isn’t the only accommodation it has made to answer complaints about its MacBook line. Apple also altered how the laptop dissipates heat, allowing the processor to run faster and more predictably. It also brought back a physical Esc key and most pro users’ preferred arrow key layout.</p>
            <p>am actually nervous saying that the keyboard is good now. I have reviewed the majority of the butterfly keyboard MacBooks, and with each iteration, I haven’t minded the key feel. It had a sort of gliding feeling that — to me — was almost worth the clacky sound. But those reviews were all written after a week or two of use, which is not enough time to run into a reliability problem.

                I’ve had this 16-inch MacBook Pro for the same amount of time, but I’m calling it fixed regardless because the new switch mechanism under the keys is the more traditional scissor-switch — a known quantity. Apple says it’s based on the Magic Keyboard that ships with iMacs, and sure, perhaps it is.</p>
            <p>As a keyboard, it’s up there among my favorites right now. (For the record, the one at the top of the list is the quiet keyboard on the Pixelbook Go.) Apple’s new keyboard has a full millimeter of travel (about 0.5mm more than the butterfly keyboard and 0.5mm less than the keyboard on a 2015 MacBook Pro). And though the keys aren’t especially springy, they do land with a satisfying and relatively quiet thunk.

                Apple says that it redesigned how the keycap attaches to the scissor-switch to improve stability across the key. The backlight also doesn’t bleed out around the edge of the keys. Finally, the keycaps are slightly smaller than the ones on the butterfly design, which allows them to be spaced slightly farther apart from each other and — critically — the Touch Bar. The “inverted T” layout on the arrow keys is also much easier to use than the old layout.</p>
                <img class="foto" alt="" src="images/mac.jpg">
                <p>Inside Apple, I am sure there are engineers who still believe that the butterfly keyboard is fixable. Perhaps it is, but hardware design has to take culture into account as much as it does engineering. Even if Apple were able to turn out a perfectly reliable butterfly keyboard with decent key travel and quiet clacking, nobody would trust it. Apple really had no other choice, and I’m glad it finally acceded to the inevitable.

                    The only question now is when Apple’s other laptops will get the new (old) keyboard design. Apple, of course, isn’t even hinting. But there are clues: the company has spent the last year doing the obvious things everybody has been asking for: improved iPadOS USB access, thicker phones with bigger batteries, and a Mac Pro that’s modular again. Hopefully, 2020 will be more of the same.</p>
